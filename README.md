##  Paths Covered

###  Pre Security
| Module | Description | Skills Practiced |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| [Introduction to Cyber Security](./Pre-security/introduction-to-cyber-security) | Learned about offensive and defensive security. I practiced ethical hacking on a fake bank site and worked through SOC analyst tasks using a simulated SIEM. | dirb, SIEM, IPS, threat intelligence, incident response |
| [Network Fundamentals](./Pre-security/network-fundamentals) | Covered the basics of how networks work, including routers, switches, VPNs, firewalls, ARP, packet flow, and port forwarding | OSI model, MAC vs IP, TCP/IP, VLANs, subnetting, firewalls |
| [How The Web Works](./Pre-security/how-the-web-works) | DNS, HTTP, web infrastructure, frontend/backend overview | Networking & Web Foundations |
[Linux Fundamentals](./Pre-security/linux-fundamentals) | Learned how to navigate and operate Linux systems using the command line. Covered file operations, permissions, user management, services, cron jobs, logging, and package management. | Shell navigation, file permissions, process management, service control, automation
| [Windows Fundamentals](./Pre-security/windows-fundamentals) | Explored how to navigate and manage Windows operating systems. Learned system configuration, user account control, file systems, task manager, registry, command line tools, and security features like firewall, updates, and Windows Defender. | Windows navigation, system configuration, task scheduling, command prompt usage, registry editing, update management, firewall setup, threat protection |

### Cybersecurity 101
| Module | Description | Skills Practiced |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| [Command Line](./Cybersecurity-101/command-line) | Practiced core command line skills across Windows command line, Windows PowerShell, and Linux shells. Navigated files and directories, managed users, handled permissions, interacted with services, and automated tasks. Also worked with process monitoring, hashing, remote execution, and scripting basics. | File system navigation, user and permission management, file operations, service control, PowerShell scripting, hashing, remote command execution, cross platform command line usage |
| [Networking Concepts](./Cybersecurity-101/networking-concepts) | Learned core networking fundamentals including OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing and subnets, routing, NAT, and encapsulation. Explored key protocols such as DNS, HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet, DHCP, ARP, and ICMP, along with secure versions (TLS, SSH, VPNs). Practiced using Wireshark and Tcpdump to capture, filter, and analyze traffic for troubleshooting and security insights. | OSI/TCP-IP models, subnetting, NAT, routing protocols, DHCP, DNS, HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, Telnet, ARP, ICMP, TLS/SSH/VPNs, packet capture and analysis with Wireshark and Tcpdump
